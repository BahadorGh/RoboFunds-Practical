For full explanation, please refer to docs folder. and open index.html. and then click on one of two contracts:

`myOracle.sol`
`PriceChecker.sol`

```
contracts -> 
# myOracle.sol --> Task 1
# PriceChecker --> Task 2
# NULL for task 3 (because I have found the FVM(as was saying in that youtube clip) will have better solutions  for inteacting with high load of transactions)

```

Also if there is any need, you can take a loot at `hardhat.config.js` or  `package.json`
